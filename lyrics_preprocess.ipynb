Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hock venom Adrenalin shots, the penicillin could not get the illing to stop Amoxicillin's just not real enough The criminal cop-killing hip hop villain A minimal swap to cop millions of Pac listeners You're coming with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it Like I showed you the spirit of God lives in us You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzing up? For shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up You bizzles forgot, Slizzle does not give a fuck!  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out 'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse 'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out 'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  Music is like magic, there's a certain feeling you get When you real and you spit and people are feeling your shit This is your moment, and every single minute you spend Tryna hold on to it because you may never get it again So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end Because I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me That's why you see me walking 'round like nothing's bothering me Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me You hate it but you know respect you got to give me The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate, hit me  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out 'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse 'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out 'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart And it's absurd, how people hang on every word I'll probably never get the props I feel I ever deserve But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first 'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothing could ever be worse That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers But I don't want to go forth and back in constant battles The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers So this is like a full blown attack I'm launching at 'em The track is on some battling raps who want some static? 'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters A plaque and platinum status is wack if I'm not the baddest, so  'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out 'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse 'Till the roof comes off, 'till the lights go out 'Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth 'Till the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps I'mma rip this shit, 'till my bone collapse  Until the roof (Until the roof) The roof comes off (The roof comes off) Until my legs (Until my legs) Give out from underneath me  I will not fall, I will stand tall Feels like no one can beat me\",\n",

The eye can outstare neither the sun, nor death... if i sought God it was in delirium and in the delight of temptation.  The idea of Salvation comes, i believe, from one whom suffering breaks apart. He who masters it, on the contrary, needs to be broken, to proceed on the path towards the rupture.  Nothing of what man can know, to this end, could be evaded without degradation, without sin,- is it no burden to bear the repellent scars of abandon, of election?- it leaves but a state of supplication and deserted expanses, an absorption into despair. The existence of things cannot enclose the death which it brings to me; the existence is itself projected into my death, and it is my death which encloses it. Am I deranged? Over and above quietism! Nurtured by the multitude of man's misfortune, a thousand halos like torches in the night of the spirit, a thousand traps, pitfalls of brimstone and the empty sky, prostrated face against the earth in frantic laughter...  I was beyond withstanding my own ignominy. I invoked it and blessed it. I progressed ever further into vileness and degradation. Am i resurging, intact, out of infamy?\",\n",

Cleaner than the dagger that hollowed it out. Masked and forgotten or no face at all. It's got something or nothing to say. Yeah don't we all? A trance and a trust fund stitched at the same time and sold to the hogs. All eyes on you. Whatever it takes the bottom line is the only one that you'll cross. Keep selling what they want to hear, arrogant and insincere. You've got something to say, but what's the pay? A million before you and more in line. I've seen it a thousand times.

Cause you've changed, yeah, you've changed  The sunrise, the sunset, you're hopeful and then you regret The circle never breaks With a sunrise and sunset, there's a change of heart or address Is there nothing that remains? For a sunrise or a sunset, you're manic or you're depressed Will you ever feel ok? For a sunrise or a sunset, your lover is an actress Did you really think she'd stay? For a sunrise or a sunset, you're either coming or you just left But you're always on the way Towards a sunrise or a sunset, a scribble or a sonnet They are really just the same To the sunrise or the sunset, the master and his servant Have exactly the same fate It's a sunrise and a sunset, from a cradle to a casket There is no way to escape The sunrise or the sunset, hold your sadness like a puppet Keep putting on the play  But everything you do is leading to the point Where you just won't know what to do And the moment that you're laughing There is someone there who will be laughing louder than you So it's true, the trick is complete You've become everything you said you never would be You're a fool, you're a fool  Sunrise, sunset, sunrise, sunset The sunrise and the sun sets Sunrise, sunset, the sunrise, the sun sets The sunrise, the sun sets  Sunrise, sunset, go home to your apartment Put the cassette in the tape deck And let that fever play.

Does he lay awake listening to your breath? Worried you smoke too many cigarettes? Is he coughing now? On a bathroom floor? For every speck of tile There\\'s a thousand more You won\\'t ever see But must hold inside yourself Eternally  Well, I drug your ghost across the country And we plotted out my death In every city, memories would whisper, \"Here is where you rest.\"  I was determined in Chicago But I dug my teeth into my knees And I settled for a telephone Sang into your machine,  \"You are my sunshine, My only sunshine. You are my sunshine, My only sunshine.\"  And I kissed a girl with a broken jaw That her father gave to her She had eyes bright enough to burn me; They reminded me of yours And in a story told, she was a little girl in a red-rouge, sun-bruised field And there were rows of ripe tomatoes, where a secret was concealed And it rose like thunder Clapped under our hands And it stretched for centuries To a diary entry\\'s end Where I wrote,  \"You make me happy, Oh, when skies are gray. You make me happy Oh, when skies are gray, and gray, and gray.\"  Well the clock\\'s heart it hangs inside its open chest With its hands stretched towards the calendar hanging itself But I will not weep For those dying days For all the ones who\\'ve left There\\'s a few that stayed And they found me here And pulled me from the grass Where I was laid',\n",

You thought you could keep me from loving, You thought you could feed on my soul. But while you were busy destroying my life, What was half in me has become whole.

My blood flows a velvet red Into that familiar stream of tears With passion I spit upon that empty face Were you disgraced when I broke your sacred circle? I must admit I was afraid this world would hurt you As you hurt me  Crossed paths to speak but for an instant Now gone without one trace What is it about my vocal pattern which leaves me speaking to self? Ugly blood pours from a warm heartfelt vase Flowers scattered on a cold stone floor Connect nevermore I am torn by my lack of emotions and plentitude of tears Callous heart hurts none, yet weeps Am I dead lord? Am I dead?

So invincible then, Before these times I learned to bleed On my knees I prayed for us As what we were slipped between my fingers Those memories still linger  Anger permeates It's not our idiosyncrasies which leave us ill I wish to build, yet it seems all I touch dies Endless drone of sighs to convince this world we exist Loveless bliss Content just to be spent at nights end Fish for your reasons in the sea of ignorance As if in trance, succumb to an ageless waltz of thought Why were we brought together only to fall apart?  My yesterdays don't matter now, they're gone Your careless expression left my wrists torn Yesterdays don't matter now, you're gone Shattered glass of empty bottles cut my palms  I gaze upon you one final time I only gaze to truly know what was once mine I toast with final swig of liquid life Lay my head 'mongst familiar curves And forever close my eyes\",\n",

But all things move toward their end, All things move toward their end — On that you can be sure  Hit it! Mmm...  Then one morning I woke to find her weeping and for many days to follow She grew so sad and lonely; Became Joy in name only Within her breast there launched an unnamed sorrow and a dark and grim force set sail \"Farewell happy fields, Where joy forever dwells, Hail, horrors, hail!\"  Was it an act of contrition, or some awful premonition? As if she saw into of her final blood-soaked night; Those lunatic eyes, That hungry kitchen knife Ah, I see, sir, that I have your attention! Well, could it be? How often have I asked that question? Well, then in quick succession we had babies, one, two, three  We called them Hilda, Hattie and Holly; They were their mother\\'s children: Their eyes were bright blue jewels and they were quiet as a mouse, There was no laughter in the house, No, not from Hilda, Hattie or Holly \"No wonder\", people said, \"poor mother Joy\\'s so melancholy\" Well, one night, there came a visitor to our little home I was visiting a sick friend; I was a doctor then; Joy and the girls were on their own  Yeah... Oh yeah...  Joy had been bound with electrical tape, In her mouth a gag; She\\'d been stabbed repeatedly and stuffed into a sleeping bag In their very cots my girls were robbed of their lives Method of murder much the same way as my wife\\'s Method of murder much the same way as my wife\\'s It was midnight when I arrived home Said to the police on the telephone \"Someone\\'s taken four innocent lives!\"  They never caught the man; He\\'s still on the loose. It seems he\\'s done many, many more Quotes John Milton on the walls in the victim\\'s blood The police are investigating at tremendous cost In my house he wrote, \"[his red right hand]\" That, I\\'m told, is from Paradise Lost The wind round here gets wicked cold But my story is nearly told; I fear the morning will bring quite a frost  So I\\'ve left my home I drift from land to land I am upon your step and you are a family man — Outside, the vultures wheel, The wolves howl, The serpents hiss, And to extend this small favor, friend, would be the sum of earthly bliss Do you reckon me a friend? The sun to me is dark and silent as the moon — Do you, sir, have a room? Are you beckoning me in?  Hit it! [[chorus]]]',\n",

What providence What divine intelligence That you should survive as well as me  It gives my heart great joy To see your eyes fill with fear To lean in close and I will whisper The last words you'll hear Oh oh\",\n",

       " {'lyrics': 'There is a man that I know. Seventeen years, he never spoke. Guessed he had nothing to say. He opened his mouth on judgment day.  I listened with all of my might. But was scared by the look in his eyes. Like he\\'d already lost the fight, And there was no hope ever in sight.  No hope in the air, No hope in the water. Not even for me, Your last serving daughter.  Why fear death, Be scared of living. Oh, hearts are small and ever thinning. There is no hope ever of winning. Oh, why fear death, Be scared of living.  I have seen men provoked. And I have seen lives revoked. And I looked at my life and I choked. From there no more ever I spoke.  I can\\'t give up that quick. My life is a candle and a wick. You can put it out, but you can\\'t break it down. In the end we are waiting to be lit.  There\\'s hope in the air, There\\'s hope in the water. But sadly, not me, Your last serving daughter.  A friend is a friend forever, And a good one will never leave, never. But you\\'ve never been south of what blows off your mouth. You will never understand the ever.  You speak minds handed down to you, By the lies handed down by your children, And your angels that dance to your will, Will mask your scrambling fall.  I forgave you, your short comings, And ignored your childish behavior. Let a kiss on your head, And before I left said, \"stay away from fleeting failure.\"  There\\'s hope in the air, There\\'s hope in the water. But sadly, not me, Your last serving daughter.  Pick up your rope, Lord, Sling it to me. If we are to battle, I must not be weak. And give us your strength, Lord, And your food and your water. Oh, I am your savior, Your last serving daughter  There\\'s hope in the air, There\\'s hope in the water. But sadly, not me, Your last serving daughter.  There\\'s hoping in the air, There\\'s hope in the water. But no hope for me, Your last serving daughter.',\n",

How could you need me now? Its getting to be so cold  The decision is in and I won't break You cut and you run with our lives at stake Well, someone might get hurt and it won't be me  The decision is in there will be no fight It might sound cold but I know its right Cause someone must get hurt and it won't be me\",\n",
